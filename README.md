# Healthcare Cost and Utilization Projects

Thank you for visiting my github! 

Analytical reports and powerpoints are available upon request.

Cesarean Sections rank in the top 5 highest cost hospital procedures and research ranks it as the top performed procedure at hospitals resulting in 1 in 3 babies being born via cesarean section. Given this, I completed a project conducting analytical analysis on cesarean section risk factors and costs. 
Some of the analytics for that project are provided. Additional details and reports are available upon request. 

Here is the SAS code I wrote to conduct logistic regression analysis for the healthcare cost and utilization data set - HCUP -  (see here for more details: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/).  I combined data sets for the state of New York for the years 2013 and 2014. Using ICD codes, I segmented the dataset by procedure types before conducting the regression analysis. I also used advanced statistical SAS programming techniques (ie - SAS arrays). HCUP data is available for purchase. And for that reason,  I did not upload the actual data set. Instead I provided a link to the data set for additional details.
