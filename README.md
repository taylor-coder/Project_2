# Healthcare Cost and Utilization Projects



Analytical reports/data visualizations are available upon request.

Deliveries via cesarean section rank in the top 5 highest cost hospital procedures. Research ranks it as the most performed procedure at hospitals. One in three babies are born via cesarean section. Given this, I completed a project conducting data analysis on cesarean section risk factors and costs to provide best practice recommendations, based on state and national trends, to the Medical Center at Columbia University. 

A portion of the analytics for that project are provided. 

Here is the SAS code I wrote to conduct logistic regression analysis for the healthcare cost and utilization data set - HCUP -  (see here for more details: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/).  I combined data sets for the state of New York for the years 2013 and 2014. Using ICD codes, I segmented the dataset by procedure types before conducting the regression analysis. I also used advanced statistical SAS programming techniques (ie - SAS arrays). HCUP data is available for purchase. And for that reason,  I did not upload the actual data set. Instead I provided a link to the data set for additional details.
