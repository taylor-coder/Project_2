# Healthcare Cost and Utilization Projects

Thank you for visiting my github! 

Analytical reports and powerpoints are available upon request.

Here is the SAS code I wrote to conduct logistic regression analysis for the healthcare cost and utilization data set - HCUP -  (see here for more details: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/).  I combined data sets for the state of New York for the years 2013 and 2014. Using ICD codes, I segmented the dataset by procedure types before conducting the regression analysis. I also used advanced statistical SAS programming techniques (ie - SAS arrays). HCUP data is available for purchase. And for that reason,  I did not upload the actual data set. Instead I provided a link to the data set for additional details.
