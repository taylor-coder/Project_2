# Project_2

Thank you for visiting my GitHub!

Here is the SAS code I wrote to conduct logistic regression analysis for the healthcare cost and utilization data set - HCUP -  (see here for more details: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/).  I combined data sets for the state of New York for the years 2013 and 2014. Using ICD codes, I segmented the dataset by procedure types before conducting the regression analysis. I also used advanced statistical SAS programming techniques (ie - SAS arrays). HCUP data is available for purchase and for that reason I did not upload the actual data set and instead provided a link to the data set for additional details.
