# Healthcare Cost and Utilization 

Analytical reports/data visualizations are available upon request.

Deliveries via cesarean section rank in the top 5 highest cost hospital procedures. Research ranks it as the most performed procedure at hospitals. One in three babies are born via cesarean section. Given this, I completed a project conducting data analysis on cesarean section risk factors and costs to provide best practice recommendations, based on state and national trends, to the Medical Center at Columbia University. 

A portion of the analytics for that project are provided. 

Here is the SAS code I wrote to conduct logistic regression analysis for the healthcare cost and utilization data set - HCUP -  (see here for more details: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/).  I combined data sets for the state of New York for the years 2013 and 2014. Using ICD codes, I segmented the dataset by procedure types before conducting the regression analysis. I also used advanced statistical SAS programming techniques (ie - SAS arrays). HCUP data is available for purchase. And for that reason,  I did not upload the actual data set. Instead I provided a link to the data set for additional details.

Descriptive Analytics via SAS

Unfortunately, I am unable to share some of the best parts of this project because much of the analysis is not publicly available. However, the portions that can be made publicly available upon request (the descriptive analytics) were presented.

Survey analysis can become complex, and statisticians and data scientists are often consulted both during survey design and for survey analysis. Often descriptive analytics should be one of the first steps in analyzing survey data and ideally a statistician should help design the survey before being administered - as was the case for ASPPH - an amazing organization working for the betterment of society. More details are available upon request.

I worked on this project with the Dean of the School of Public Health and Professors in Biostatistics and Computer Science at NYU to design the survey, create a website to administer the survey, collect data, and analyze the preliminary results.

I was the sole author of the SAS code and provided some of the SAS code for reference.

This is a simple descriptive analytics project I conducted on a dataset consisting of the responses to a survey on behalf of the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health. I am providing some of the preliminary results to my data science consulting project I completed years ago. I created a concise report in Excel of the descriptive analytics and provided recommendations for analyzing the data.

More detailed analytical reports are available upon request.
